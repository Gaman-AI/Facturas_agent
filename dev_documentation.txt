## 2024-12-19 - .gitignore Updates for Team Collaboration

### Changes Made:
1. **Updated main .gitignore** to be more team-friendly while maintaining security
2. **Updated frontend/.gitignore** to allow proper collaboration
3. **Updated backend/browser-use/.gitignore** to ensure browser-use folder is accessible
4. **Added explicit rules** to keep browser-use folder and its contents

### Key Changes:
- **Security First**: All environment variables and secrets are still ignored
- **Team Collaboration**: Removed overly restrictive patterns that would prevent teammates from running the project
- **Browser-use Protection**: Added explicit rules to keep the browser-use folder and its contents
- **Lock Files**: Removed uv.lock from ignore list to ensure reproducible builds
- **Documentation**: Added clear comments explaining what should and shouldn't be ignored

### Files Updated:
- `.gitignore` (main)
- `frontend/.gitignore`
- `backend/browser-use/.gitignore`

### Important Notes:
- Environment files (.env*) are still ignored for security
- Example environment files (!*.env.example) are allowed
- Browser-use folder is explicitly kept with `!backend/browser-use/` and `!backend/browser-use/**`
- Lock files should be committed for reproducible builds
- Cache and build artifacts are kept local for performance

### For Teammates:
- Clone the repository
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials
- Run `npm install` in frontend directory
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in backend directory
- The browser-use folder will be available for all team members
