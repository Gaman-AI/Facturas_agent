## 2024-12-19 - .gitignore Updates for Team Collaboration

### Changes Made:
1. **Updated main .gitignore** to be more team-friendly while maintaining security
2. **Updated frontend/.gitignore** to allow proper collaboration
3. **Updated backend/browser-use/.gitignore** to ensure browser-use folder is accessible
4. **Added explicit rules** to keep browser-use folder and its contents

### Key Changes:
- **Security First**: All environment variables and secrets are still ignored
- **Team Collaboration**: Removed overly restrictive patterns that would prevent teammates from running the project
- **Browser-use Protection**: Added explicit rules to keep the browser-use folder and its contents
- **Lock Files**: Removed uv.lock from ignore list to ensure reproducible builds
- **Documentation**: Added clear comments explaining what should and shouldn't be ignored

### Files Updated:
- `.gitignore` (main)
- `frontend/.gitignore`
- `backend/browser-use/.gitignore`

### Important Notes:
- Environment files (.env*) are still ignored for security
- Example environment files (!*.env.example) are allowed
- Browser-use folder is explicitly kept with `!backend/browser-use/` and `!backend/browser-use/**`
- Lock files should be committed for reproducible builds
- Cache and build artifacts are kept local for performance

### For Teammates:
- Clone the repository
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials
- Run `npm install` in frontend directory
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in backend directory
- The browser-use folder will be available for all team members

## 2024-12-19 - Fixed Translation Loading Issues in LanguageSwitcherDemo

### Problem Identified:
The `LanguageSwitcherDemo.tsx` component was displaying translation keys instead of actual translations due to timing issues with the translation loading system. The issue was not missing translation keys, but rather a race condition where components rendered before translations were fully loaded.

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Translation Loading Timing**: Translations were not loaded when components first rendered
2. **Missing Loading State Handling**: Components didn't wait for translations to load
3. **Inadequate Fallbacks**: The `t()` function returned keys when translations were empty
4. **State Synchronization Issues**: Language state changes didn't properly trigger re-renders

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Enhanced LanguageContext (`frontend/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx`):
- **Improved `loadTranslations` function**: Added validation for loaded translation modules
- **Better error handling**: Enhanced fallback mechanism with proper error recovery
- **Optimized `setLanguage` function**: Added proper loading state management during language switching
- **Enhanced `t()` function**: Added intelligent fallbacks with common translations during loading state
- **Loading state fallbacks**: Implemented language-aware fallbacks for common keys during initial load

#### 2. Enhanced LanguageSwitcherDemo (`frontend/components/demo/LanguageSwitcherDemo.tsx`):
- **Added loading state handling**: Component now shows loading indicator instead of broken translations
- **Graceful degradation**: Shows content with fallbacks rather than blocking the entire UI
- **Loading indicator**: Added subtle loading spinner with status message
- **Import optimization**: Added LoadingSpinner component import

#### 3. State Synchronization Improvements:
- **Proper loading states**: `setIsLoading(true)` before language changes
- **Error recovery**: Reset loading state on errors with proper error propagation
- **Cache validation**: Validate cached translations before using them

### Technical Implementation:

#### Translation Loading Flow:
1. Initial language detection from localStorage or browser
2. Set loading state to true
3. Load translations with validation
4. Cache translations for faster subsequent loads
5. Set loading state to false
6. Preload alternate language in background

#### Fallback System:
- During loading: Language-aware fallbacks for common keys
- On error: Graceful fallback to Spanish translations
- Last resort: Return translation key if all else fails

#### Loading State Management:
- Show subtle loading indicator instead of blocking UI
- Maintain functionality during translation loading
- Proper state transitions for better UX

### Files Updated:
- `frontend/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx` - Enhanced translation loading and state management
- `frontend/components/demo/LanguageSwitcherDemo.tsx` - Added loading state handling and graceful degradation

### Testing Results:
- Build successful with no TypeScript or linting errors
- Translation loading now works correctly with proper fallbacks
- Language switching maintains smooth user experience
- No more translation key display issues

### Impact:
- **User Experience**: Eliminated broken translation display
- **Performance**: Faster initial load with intelligent caching
- **Reliability**: Better error handling and recovery
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner code with proper state management

### For Future Development:
- Translation loading is now robust and handles edge cases
- Loading states provide better user feedback
- Error boundaries prevent translation failures from breaking the UI
- System is ready for additional languages if needed

## 2024-12-19 - Fixed Language Switching for Dashboard and Other Pages

### Problem Identified:
The language switching was working correctly for login and register pages, but not for the dashboard and other pages. The issue was that these pages were using hardcoded Spanish text instead of the translation system.

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Dashboard Page**: Used hardcoded Spanish text instead of translation keys
2. **Browser-Agent-Realtime Page**: Used hardcoded Spanish text and was missing 'use client' directive
3. **CFDITaskForm Component**: Had extensive hardcoded Spanish text throughout the form
4. **Missing Translation Keys**: Many translation keys were missing from the translation files

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Fixed Dashboard Page (`frontend/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`):
- **Added translation import**: Imported `useLanguage` hook
- **Replaced hardcoded text**: Converted all Spanish text to use translation keys
- **Enhanced user experience**: All dashboard elements now support language switching
- **Added missing keys**: Created new translation keys for dashboard-specific content

#### 2. Fixed Browser-Agent-Realtime Page (`frontend/app/browser-agent-realtime/page.tsx`):
- **Added 'use client' directive**: Fixed server-side rendering issue
- **Added translation support**: Imported and used `useLanguage` hook
- **Replaced hardcoded text**: Converted page title and description to use translations

#### 3. Enhanced CFDITaskForm Component (`frontend/components/CFDITaskForm.tsx`):
- **Added translation import**: Imported `useLanguage` hook
- **Comprehensive translation**: Converted all form labels, placeholders, and descriptions
- **Currency support**: Added translation for currency names and descriptions
- **Form validation**: Maintained validation while adding translation support

#### 4. Enhanced Translation Files:
- **Added dashboard keys**: New keys for dashboard-specific content
- **Added task form keys**: Comprehensive set of keys for the CFDI task form
- **Added currency keys**: Translation for currency names and descriptions
- **Added profile keys**: Additional profile-related translation keys

### New Translation Keys Added:

#### Dashboard Keys:
- `dashboard.welcome`: Welcome message
- `dashboard.quickActions`: Quick actions section title
- `dashboard.viewHistory`: View history button
- `dashboard.systemStatus`: System status card title
- `dashboard.systemOperational`: System operational status

#### Task Form Keys:
- `tasks.createNewTask`: New task form title
- `tasks.formDescription`: Form description
- `tasks.vendorInfo`: Vendor information section
- `tasks.vendorUrl`: Vendor URL field

- **Profile Display**: All profile information now translatable

#### Client-Side Rendering:
- Fixed server-side rendering issues with proper 'use client' directives
- Maintained performance while ensuring translation functionality

#### Fallback System:
- All new translation keys include fallback values
- Graceful degradation when translations are loading
- Language-aware fallbacks for better user experience

### Files Updated:
- `frontend/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added translation support
