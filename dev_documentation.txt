MIGRATION TO MCP SUPABASE SERVER
=====================================

SUMMARY:
Successfully migrated the application from traditional Supabase client libraries to MCP Supabase Server integration. Updated database schema to match the full CFDI registration requirements.

CHANGES MADE:

1. UPDATED FRONTEND LIBRARIES:

   A. lib/supabase.ts:
   - Removed traditional @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs and @supabase/supabase-js imports
   - Added MCP Supabase Server integration with MCPSupabaseClient class
   - Updated TypeScript types to match actual database schema from project "LLM_facturation" (ID: pffuarlnpdpfjrvewrqo)
   - Created database operation methods: insert, select, update, delete
   - Added auth methods: signUp, signIn, signOut, getSession

   B. types/auth.ts:
   - Updated auth types to match full CFDI database schema
   - Full user profile structure:
     * Required: rfc, razon_social, calle, numero_ext, colonia, delegacion_municipio, codigo_postal, estado, regimen_fiscal, uso_cfdi
     * Optional: numero_int
   - Individual address fields instead of JSON address object
   - Updated RegisterData interface to match complete CFDI schema

   C. lib/validation.ts:
   - Updated validation schemas to match full CFDI registration form structure
   - RFC validation matching SAT pattern: /^[A-ZÑ&]{3,4}[0-9]{6}[A-V1-9][A-Z1-9][0-9A]$/
   - All address fields as individual required fields (except numero_int)
   - CFDI configuration fields: regimen_fiscal and uso_cfdi

   D. components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx:
   - Updated form fields to match complete CFDI schema
   - Three organized sections: Datos de Acceso, Dirección Fiscal, Configuración CFDI
   - Individual address fields with proper validation
   - RFC type detection for filtering regimens and CFDI uses
   - Modern UI with icons and clear field grouping

   E. types/cfdi.ts:
   - Complete CFDI types and constants
   - 26 Regímenes Fiscales with proper categorization (Persona Física/Moral/Both)
   - 22 Usos de CFDI with applicability rules
   - 32 Mexican states with proper codes

2. CREATED BACKEND MCP INTEGRATION:

   A. src/services/mcp_supabase_service.py:
   - Created MCPSupabaseService base class for database operations
   - Created MCPAuthService extending base class for authentication
   - Updated methods for full CFDI profile creation and management
   - Configured for Supabase project ID: pffuarlnpdpfjrvewrqo

   B. src/api/endpoints/mcp_auth.py:
   - Created new authentication endpoints using MCP Supabase Server
   - Updated registration endpoint with complete CFDI profile creation
   - All individual address and CFDI configuration fields
   - Added email and RFC availability check endpoints
   - Implemented JWT token creation and validation

3. DATABASE SCHEMA MIGRATION:

   Applied migration: update_user_profiles_full_schema
   
   Updated user_profiles table structure:
   - Removed: company_name, phone, address (JSON), fiscal_regime, postal_code
   - Added individual fields:
     * razon_social (TEXT NOT NULL)
     * calle (TEXT NOT NULL)
     * numero_ext (TEXT NOT NULL)
     * numero_int (TEXT) - optional
     * colonia (TEXT NOT NULL)
     * delegacion_municipio (TEXT NOT NULL)
     * codigo_postal (TEXT NOT NULL) with 5-digit constraint
     * estado (TEXT NOT NULL)
     * regimen_fiscal (TEXT NOT NULL)
     * uso_cfdi (TEXT NOT NULL)

4. REGISTRATION FLOW:

   COMPLETE CFDI SCHEMA:
   - Authentication: email, password (min 6 chars)
   - Fiscal Info: RFC (SAT pattern), razon_social
   - Address: calle, numero_ext, numero_int (optional), colonia, delegacion_municipio, codigo_postal (5 digits), estado
   - CFDI Config: regimen_fiscal, uso_cfdi
   - RFC validation determines available regimens and CFDI uses
   - Form organized in logical sections with proper validation

5. TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:

   - Better type safety with generated TypeScript types from actual database
   - Comprehensive form validation matching SAT requirements
   - Individual address field storage for better data integrity
   - Smart filtering of regimens and CFDI uses based on RFC type
   - Clean separation of form sections for better UX
   - Fixed hydration errors with proper client-side mounting

NEXT STEPS:
1. Test registration flow with actual MCP Supabase Server
2. Implement actual MCP tool calls in backend service
3. Add proper error handling and validation
4. Update frontend auth context to use new endpoints
5. Test RFC validation and regimen/CFDI filtering

CONFIGURATION:
- Supabase Project: LLM_facturation (pffuarlnpdpfjrvewrqo)
- Region: us-east-2
- Status: ACTIVE_HEALTHY
- Database Schema: Full CFDI 4.0 compliant

RESOLVED ISSUES:
- React hydration error fixed with suppressHydrationWarning and mounted state
- Dependency conflicts resolved by removing incompatible React packages
- Form validation aligned with SAT CFDI requirements
- Database schema matches complete registration form structure

FRONTEND DEPENDENCY ISSUES FIXED
=====================================

ISSUE: Frontend build was failing due to dependency conflicts:
1. `date-fns@4.1.0` was incompatible with `react-day-picker@8.10.1` which requires `date-fns@^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0`
2. `react-day-picker@8.10.1` doesn't support React 19, only React 16, 17, or 18

SOLUTION:
1. Updated `frontend/package.json` to use `date-fns@^3.6.0` instead of `date-fns@4.1.0`
2. Installed dependencies using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to bypass React version conflicts
3. Successfully built frontend with `npm run build`
4. Started development server with `npm run dev` on http://localhost:3000

NOTES:
- The backend virtual environment appears to be Windows-based but the user is on macOS
- Frontend is now fully functional for local testing
- There is 1 critical severity vulnerability reported by npm audit (can be addressed later if needed)

MERGE CONFLICT RESOLUTION
=====================================

ISSUE: Git merge conflict in dev_documentation.txt file during branch merge
- Current branch: users/aanwi/frontend_dev (frontend dependency fixes from Jan 28)
- Incoming branch: MCP Supabase migration documentation (from Jan 23)
- Both branches had added different content to the same file

RESOLUTION:
1. Analyzed both versions of dev_documentation.txt using git staging area
2. Merged content chronologically, preserving all documentation:
   - Kept MCP Supabase migration documentation first (January 23, 2025)
   - Added frontend dependency fixes documentation second (January 28, 2025)
   - Maintained professional formatting and complete change history
3. Staged resolved file with `git add dev_documentation.txt`
4. Completed merge with descriptive commit message

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Used `git ls-files -u` to identify conflicted files
- Used `git show :2:` and `git show :3:` to examine both versions
- Combined both documentation entries without losing any information
- Followed chronological order to maintain development timeline
- Added this documentation entry to record the resolution process

OUTCOME:
- Merge completed successfully with commit hash: b1a74142
- All development history preserved
- No information lost from either branch
- Repository now in clean state for continued development
