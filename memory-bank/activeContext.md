- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication infrastructure
- **Authentication Middleware**: JWT verification and RLS implementation

**Current Focus Areas**:
```

├── config/          # Database and Redis configuration
├── middleware/      # Auth, validation, error handling
├── api/endpoints/   # Route handlers for tasks and auth
├── services/        # Business logic layer
└── websockets/      # Real-time communication
```

#### 2. Database Implementation
**Priority**: High | **Status**: Starting

- **Supabase Project Setup**: Database and authentication configuration
- **Schema Migration**: User profiles, tasks, and logs table creation
- **Row-Level Security**: Multi-tenant data isolation policies
- **Indexes and Performance**: Query optimization for task management

**Key Tables to Implement**:
- `user_profiles` (RFC, tax regime, postal code)
- `automation_tasks` (vendor URL, ticket data, status)
- `task_logs` (agent actions and status updates)
- `browser_sessions` (Browserbase session management)

#### 3. AI Agent Integration
**Priority**: Medium | **Status**: Planning

- **Browser-Use Agent Setup**: AI automation engine configuration
- **Browserbase Integration**: Live browser streaming implementation
- **Task Orchestration**: Agent lifecycle management
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic and user intervention flows

   - [ ] shadcn/ui component library integration
   - [ ] Authentication flow implementation
   - [ ] Basic dashboard and task submission forms

2. **Real-Time Interface**

   - [ ] Dual-pane layout (70% browser view, 30% sidebar)
   - [ ] Status updates and logging display
   - [ ] Interactive session controls

#### AI Agent Integration
1. **Browser-Use Agent**
   - [ ] Agent service implementation
   - [ ] Browserbase session management

   - [ ] Session state management
   - [ ] User control handoff

### Current Technical Challenges

#### 1. External Service Integration
**Challenge**: Integrating Browser-Use agent with Browserbase for live streaming
**Approach**: 
- Start with basic agent implementation
- Add Browserbase streaming incrementally
- Implement fallback mechanisms for service failures

#### 2. Real-Time State Management
**Challenge**: Synchronizing agent state across WebSocket clients
**Approach**:
- Redis pub/sub for event distribution
- Stateless backend design for scalability
- Client-side state reconciliation

#### 3. Security Implementation
**Challenge**: Ensuring secure multi-tenant data isolation
**Approach**:
- Supabase RLS policies for database-level security
- JWT middleware for API authentication
- Encrypted storage for sensitive data (RFC, credentials)

### Development Priorities

#### High Priority (Blocking)
1. **Backend API Foundation**: Core endpoints for auth and task management
2. **Database Setup**: Supabase configuration with proper schema
