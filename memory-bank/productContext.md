# Product Context: CFDI 4.0 Automation Solution

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
Mexican businesses face significant operational overhead with CFDI 4.0 invoice form submissions:

- **Manual Repetition**: Business owners spend hours daily filling identical forms across multiple vendor portals

- **Time Inefficiency**: Small businesses lose 15-20 hours weekly on administrative form filling

- **Compliance Burden**: CFDI 4.0 requirements create additional administrative complexity

### Business Impact
- **Productivity Loss**: Administrative overhead prevents focus on core business activities
