# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Small businesses and freelancers in Mexico spend **hours every week** manually filling out CFDI 4.0 invoicing forms across various vendor portals. This repetitive administrative task:

- **Wastes valuable time** - Up to 3-5 hours weekly on form submissions
- **Prone to human errors** - Manual data entry leads to rejected invoices
- **Lacks transparency** - Users have no visibility into automated processes
- **Creates frustration** - Each vendor portal has different layouts and requirements
- **Scales poorly** - More clients = exponentially more manual work

### The Market Opportunity
- **5+ million** small businesses in Mexico dealing with CFDI compliance
- **Average 30-50 invoices** per month per business requiring manual submission
- **85% time reduction** potential through intelligent automation
- **$50-200 monthly value** per user in time savings

## How Our Solution Works

### Core User Experience
1. **Simple Task Submission**: User inputs ticket details + vendor URL
2. **Real-Time Transparency**: Watch automation happen via embedded browser (70% screen)
3. **Intelligent Monitoring**: Live status updates in sidebar (30% screen) 
4. **Seamless Intervention**: One-click takeover when manual input needed
5. **Complete Control**: Pause, resume, or take control at any time

### Unique Value Propositions

#### 1. **Real-Time Transparency** 
Unlike other automation tools, users see exactly what's happening through embedded Browserbase Live View iFrames - no black box automation.

#### 2. **Seamless User Intervention**
When the agent encounters CAPTCHA or login issues, users can instantly take control through the same browser session without losing context.

#### 3. **Universal Vendor Support**
Works with ANY vendor portal through generalized CFDI automation patterns, not tied to specific vendor APIs.

#### 4. **Spanish-First Design**
Built specifically for Mexican users with Spanish localization, CFDI expertise, and LFPDPPP compliance.

#### 5. **Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture**
Enterprise-grade security with encrypted data storage, JWT authentication, and Row-Level Security.
