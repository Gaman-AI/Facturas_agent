#### Component Architecture
```
DashboardPage
├── Sidebar (Professional navigation)
└── Main Content
    ├── Header (Status indicator)
    └── Content Area (Split view)

        └── Task History (Task management)

TaskExecutionPage
├── Task Header (Controls and info)
└── Main Content (Split view)
    ├── Agent Activity Panel (Real-time steps)
    └── Browser Preview Panel (Live view)
```

#### Data Structure
- **Task**: id, prompt, status, created_at, completed_at
- **TaskStep**: id, step_type, content, timestamp
- **Status Types**: pending, running, paused, completed, failed
- **Step Types**: thinking, action, observation, error

### User Experience Improvements
