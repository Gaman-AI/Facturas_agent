# CFDI Agent Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing the existing CFDI (electronic invoice) automation agent to handle the complexities of Mexican tax compliance portals. The agent must reliably submit invoices across diverse vendor portals while overcoming anti-bot defenses, dynamic UI changes, and session management challenges.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Robust Element Discovery

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the agent to reliably find form fields across different portal technologies, so that invoice submission works regardless of the vendor's technical implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent encounters a form field THEN it SHALL attempt visual anchor detection first (labels, placeholders)
2. IF visual detection fails THEN the agent SHALL cycle through 3 selector fallbacks from vendor profile
3. WHEN all selectors fail THEN the agent SHALL log "SELECTOR_DRIFT" error and attempt DOM analysis
4. IF the page uses shadow DOM THEN the agent SHALL penetrate shadow roots to find elements
5. WHEN elements load lazily THEN the agent SHALL wait for DOM stability before proceeding

### Requirement 2: Anti-Bot Defense Evasion

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the agent to avoid detection by portal security systems, so that my automation doesn't get blocked or banned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN typing in fields THEN the agent SHALL use 120-250ms random intervals between keystrokes
2. WHEN navigating between actions THEN the agent SHALL wait 500-1500ms with random variation
3. WHEN the browser launches THEN the agent SHALL disable webdriver flags and use Mexican locale headers
4. IF a CAPTCHA appears THEN the agent SHALL capture screenshot and pause for manual resolution
5. WHEN filling forms THEN the agent SHALL simulate mouse movements and focus events
6. IF rate limiting is detected THEN the agent SHALL implement exponential backoff

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Session Management

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the agent to handle session timeouts and CSRF tokens automatically, so that long-running processes don't fail due to authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session expires THEN the agent SHALL detect the condition and attempt re-authentication
2. IF CSRF tokens are present THEN the agent SHALL extract and include them in form submissions
3. WHEN idle for 45 seconds THEN the agent SHALL perform a keep-alive action
4. IF authentication is required THEN the agent SHALL follow vendor-specific auth steps
5. WHEN session state changes THEN the agent SHALL update context accordingly

### Requirement 4: Intelligent File Upload Handling

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the agent to successfully upload XML and PDF files through various upload interfaces, so that invoice documents are properly attached.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering file upload fields THEN the agent SHALL detect the upload mechanism type
2. IF drag-and-drop is required THEN the agent SHALL simulate proper drag events
3. WHEN files are uploading THEN the agent SHALL wait for 100% progress confirmation
4. IF upload fails THEN the agent SHALL retry up to 3 times with different approaches
5. WHEN upload completes THEN the agent SHALL verify success indicators (✔ or "Subido/Éxito" text)

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Error Recovery

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the agent to recover from common errors automatically, so that temporary issues don't cause complete task failure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selector errors occur THEN the agent SHALL classify error type and determine retry strategy
2. IF validation errors appear THEN the agent SHALL capture error details and halt (non-retryable)
3. WHEN network timeouts happen THEN the agent SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. IF modal dialogs appear THEN the agent SHALL auto-dismiss them once and retry the action
5. WHEN unexpected page changes occur THEN the agent SHALL re-analyze the DOM structure

### Requirement 6: Success Detection and Reporting

**User Story:** As a business user, I want clear confirmation when invoice submission succeeds, so that I know the process completed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submission completes THEN the agent SHALL scan for success patterns in Spanish
2. IF success indicators are found THEN the agent SHALL extract confirmation details (folio, status)
3. WHEN the process finishes THEN the agent SHALL return structured success/failure response
4. IF partial success occurs THEN the agent SHALL report what was completed vs. what failed
5. WHEN logging throughout THEN the agent SHALL provide detailed step-by-step execution logs

### Requirement 7: Vendor Profile Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure vendor-specific behaviors, so that the agent can adapt to different portal requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing invoices THEN the agent SHALL load appropriate vendor profile based on URL
2. IF no specific profile exists THEN the agent SHALL use generic fallback configuration
3. WHEN vendor UI changes THEN the agent SHALL support multiple selector fallbacks per field
4. IF special requirements exist THEN the agent SHALL apply vendor-specific handling rules
5. WHEN new vendors are added THEN the agent SHALL support profile extension without code changes

### Requirement 8: Human Control and Intervention

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to pause, resume, or take control of the agent when needed, so that I can intervene when complex blockers occur that exceed the agent's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks pause THEN the agent SHALL pause execution and maintain current browser state
2. WHEN the user clicks resume THEN the agent SHALL continue from the paused state
3. WHEN the user clicks stop THEN the agent SHALL terminate execution and provide status summary
4. IF complex blockers occur THEN the agent SHALL automatically pause and request human assistance
5. WHEN human takes control THEN the agent SHALL monitor browser state changes and resume when control is returned
6. WHEN control is returned to agent THEN the agent SHALL analyze current page state and continue task execution
7. IF the embedded browser interface is active THEN the user SHALL have direct browser interaction capabilities

### Requirement 9: Frontend Browser Control Integration

**User Story:** As a business user, I want an embedded browser interface with control buttons, so that I can monitor agent progress and intervene when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent starts THEN the frontend SHALL display an embedded browser view with real-time screenshots
2. WHEN the agent is running THEN the interface SHALL show pause, resume, and stop buttons
3. IF the agent pauses THEN the embedded browser SHALL allow direct user interaction
4. WHEN user interacts with embedded browser THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the agent's browser context
5. IF the agent requests help THEN the interface SHALL highlight the help request and enable user response
6. WHEN agent execution completes THEN the interface SHALL display final status and allow session review

### Requirement 10: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the agent to complete tasks efficiently without consuming excessive resources, so that it can handle multiple invoices cost-effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing invoices THEN the agent SHALL complete typical submissions within 2-5 minutes
2. IF browser memory usage exceeds limits THEN the agent SHALL restart browser session
3. WHEN multiple tasks queue THEN the agent SHALL process them sequentially to avoid conflicts
4. IF LLM token usage is high THEN the agent SHALL optimize prompts and context management
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the agent SHALL fail fast on non-retryable conditions
