1. **High-Impact Prompt**: "Think step by step to implement any code - be very careful, change as little code as possible while still ensuring desired functionality and keep logic simple like an experienced developer working in a Google team for 20+ years would. Make sure to game out the flow of logic in all possible ways to make sure everything is foolproof. Be structured, organized and use dispassionate precision." This encourages precision; similar to chain-of-thought prompting, which research shows improves AI accuracy in coding tasks.
2. **Alternative Without User Rules**: Prepend to every prompt: "Whenever I provide a task or feature to work on, ALWAYS provide a full end-to-end implementation. Make sure to ALWAYS thoroughly and comprehensively test every feature and possible failure points of all the work you do before saying it is done. DO NOT skip the testing no matter what. DO NOT come up with mock tests that just pass without truly testing underlying failure modes and functionality. If a test doesn't pass then go back and find the cause of the test failure, the underlying problem and the robust solution to solve it - then implement the fix, test again and repeat until it works - then move to the next item." This enforces rigorous testing; users on X report it reduces errors in agent-led development.
